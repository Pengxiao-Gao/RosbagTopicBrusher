# ROSBag Data Processing Tool

The provided Python script offers a versatile tool for handling ROSBag files, particularly focused on extracting, de- and re-serializing of a **ProtoBuf** data from specified topics within a ROSBag. Below is a detailed analysis of the tool's features, functionality, and usage:

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed in your Python environment.

2. **Proto File Compilation**: If the `.proto` file needs to be compiled into a Python file (`.py`), navigate to the `proto` folder within this repository and run the following command:
    ```bash
    protoc -I=. --python_out=. memory_cruise.proto
    ```

    Replace `memory_cruise.proto` with the name of your `.proto` file if it differs. This command generates a Python file based on the protobuf definition.

3. **Execution**: Run the script using the command line with the specified input and output ROSBag file paths as arguments. For example:
    ```bash
    python script_name.py --input path_to_input_bag --output path_to_output_bag
    ```

    Replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of the script file, `path_to_input_bag` with the path to the input ROSBag file, and `path_to_output_bag` with the desired path for the output ROSBag file.

4. **Analysis**: The script provides informative print statements to track the progress of data processing, including the sizes of memory cruise data, ego pose data, and any other relevant metrics.

By leveraging this tool, users can efficiently manipulate and transform data stored in ROSBag files to suit their specific requirements and application scenarios.
